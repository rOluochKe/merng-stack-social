## MERNG Stack Social App
Learning how to create a social media app using MongoDB, Express, Node, React, GraphQL, and Node (the MERNG stack). I learned how to implement a GraphQL server that uses Node and Express to communicate to a MongoDB Database and fetch and persist data to a social media app back-end.
